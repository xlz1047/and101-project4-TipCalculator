# üí∏ Tip Calculator App

Time spent: **5 hours** spent in total

## Summary

**Tip Calculator** is an Android app that helps users quickly calculate the tip, total bill, and cost per person based on the entered bill amount and tip percentage.  
It‚Äôs a simple and practical utility app built to make math at the restaurant table easier and faster ‚Äî no more guessing what 15% of your meal is!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üí∞üì±‚ú®**

## Notes

This project taught me how to use **ViewBinding** to simplify view references and make my code cleaner.  
I also learned how to handle **user input validation**, and perform **calculations dynamically** in Kotlin.  
Designing the layout helped me practice **ConstraintLayout positioning** and **color styling** in XML.  

Overall, I enjoyed building something practical and improving my confidence in Android development! üíô
